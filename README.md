Text Summarization Tool :

A text summarization tool is a software application or online service designed to automatically generate a concise and coherent summary of a longer text document. It uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques to identify the most important information in the input text, reducing redundancy while preserving key ideas and overall meaning.

Key Features:

Automatic Summarization: Extracts or abstracts key points from long articles, reports, or documents.

Input Flexibility: Supports various formats such as plain text, PDFs, web pages, and Word documents.

Customization Options: Allows users to set the desired summary length or focus on specific topics.

Language Support: Many tools support multiple languages.

Use Cases: Academic research, news aggregation, content curation, legal and business document analysis.

Types of Summarization:

Extractive Summarization: Selects and combines the most important sentences or phrases from the original text.

Abstractive Summarization: Generates new sentences that convey the core meaning, often rephrasing or paraphrasing content.
